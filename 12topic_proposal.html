          <h1>Topic Proposal</h1>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">We have chosen the idea of Microchipping in humans
            This idea is interesting as technology has developed quite far over the years. 
            An example of this would be the development of unlocking cars: To open a car you needed to use a key in the door to unlock it, the technology of this ten developed so that we only had to press a button to unlock the door, it soon then developed to only needing to stand near or touch your door handle and then the car would unlock, some cars have even developed to using key cards to unlock the car so you just need to tap the top left side of your door and the car will unlock, but it has even developed to the point where people are now getting microchips placed in their hands so they can unlock their cars without needing to hold anything in their hands.
            Having a microchip inserted into the hand isn’t a big procedure, it’s very similar to getting an injectection but it's done between your thumb and pointer finger and is the size of a grain of rice inserted with a needle the size of a piercing.
