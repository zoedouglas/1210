                  No one in our group turned up today as we were all sick.
                  We had no contact with one another.
                  Zoe did brainstorm multiple ideas for out topic/technology these consisted of self-driving cars/trucks, microchipping humans, facial recognition, apple pay and wireless charging. </td>

                <td>This was our second meeting of the assignment.
                  All of us turned up, Zoe on time and after 45 minutes Gigi and PJ turned up one by one.
                  Zoe discussed her ideas that she brainstormed, and we all decided on microchipping as we thought it was an interesting idea seeming people are willing to get a foreign object implanted into their hand.
                  We did a quick bit of research into the idea to make sure it was something we really wanted to do and then started writing down notes for our proposal we would have to present the next week.
                  Zoe tried to organise a meeting time outside of class, but no one responded to the messages sent so we weren’t able to meet up beforehand.</td>

                  At the beginning of this class, we presented our proposal that Zoe had written for the group.
                  After we presented, we then began discussing the roles that one another would take on and each specific task everyone would do.</td>

                <td>This was our fourth meeting of the assignment.
                  During this meeting we discussed the research we had done since the last meeting. Zoe had done a bit and had started the website design and Gigi had found a few sources to look at and discuss with the group about.
                  During this meeting we did even more research to try and find some good sources to use in our next presentation of the three slides. 
                  Zoe also began planning another group meeting so we could all meet up the next week before our next class meeting to discuss more of what we were doing and what we needed to do.</td>

                <th>19/05</th>
                <td>This was our fifth meeting of the assignment and our first meeting outside of class time.
                  Zoe was the first to arrive, so she worked on the website a bit more to get the base code down, PJ then arrived, and we discussed the work he was supposed to have completed by this date that he hadn’t done yet. Gigi later arrived and we went over her research before PJ left. Gigi and I stayed until the planned meeting ending time where we worked on her research she had found and looked into it more. Zoe then wrote more code for the website where she finished the base of it and made all the pages needed. </td>

                <th>21/05</th>
                <td>This was our sixth meeting of the assignment.
                  During this meeting we discussed and went over the progress we had made. Zoe helped Gigi understand what more of her tasks meant because of the language barrier seeming English isn’t Gigi’s first language. 
                  After discussing Gigi’s tasks and helping her understand, Zoe then talked to PJ about his work that he was meant to have completed but there wasn’t much there so made sure he knew what he had to do. 
                  The next week was our final presentation.</td>

                  Only Zoe and Gigi turned up to this presentation, so they discussed the work they had done seeming they were also the only ones who had imputed work into the PowerPoint for the presentation. </td>
