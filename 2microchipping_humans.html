          <h1>Microchipping Humans</h1>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">Microchipping humans is when a small chip the size of a rice grain is implanted via a needle injection into the hand between the thumb and pointer finger. The implants allow people to access their homes, offices and even their gyms simply by swiping their hands against a digital reader by the door theyâ€™re wanting to enter through. This chip also allows the user to store their emergency contacts, debit cards, e-tickets for events and public transport. More than 4,000 Swedes have begun replacing their key cards with microchips to access these locations and to store their personal data instead of having to carry around all their cards in their wallets/pockets (Smith. Z. M, 2020). This is significant because it is and will positively and negatively impact our society today and in the future. There are positives in this as it means there will be less waste with cards and keys and less chance of losing personal items. There are also a few negatives such as personal data being stolen, infection and many other health risks as the chip is a foreign object being implanted into the body.
