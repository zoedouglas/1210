          <h1>Opportunities</h1>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">Microchipping in humans has many opportunities which include things such as never having to worry about losing your wallet, car keys or house keys every again, easier identifications making it easier to get into secured locations or bars/clubs, membership access control – this allows places like gyms and secured buildings to worry less about unwanted people entering the premises as the chip is located in the persons hand unlike if they were having to use a key card to get in. </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">More opportunities are things such as easily being able to access your own personal medical history if you were ever in an emergency and needed to prove or fund your identifications, or even if you’re going for a simple doctor’s appointment or surgery the chip would hold all your personal data so that you don’t have to sit around for hours waiting for the nurse to find your correct file. Another opportunity is being able to keep an eye on your kids when they’re out with their friends or to make sure they are safe and not in need of help or anything, it would also help the police and other services when it comes to identifying criminals in different circumstances. (Hooijdonk. R, 2017).</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">Microchipping provides many opportunities. In Sweden thousands of citizens have already started getting microchips implanted into their hands. These chips are designed to help speed up their daily routines by giving them access to their homes, offices, gyms and any other digital readers their chips are linked with.  These chips are providing physical data that is stored in the cloud which can be shared and delivered to businesses to give them an insight on what is going on (only with the users’ permission). This gives companies an insight on what they could do to make their products better and more compatible with their target audience, giving them a chance to grow and possibly become popular worldwide (Banafa. A, 2021). </p>
