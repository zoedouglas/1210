          <h1>Risks</h1>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">When it comes to microchipping humans, there are many risks involved as it is a chip the size of a grain of rice which is being implanted into the human body (more specifically the hand). Many of these risks involve the health of the human receiving the microchip. These health issues include things such as tumours, infection, and death. </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">According to Dr Katherine Albrecht (Suncorp 2019), in at least 6 studies done on rodents and dogs (with similar attributes to humans) between 1990 and 2006 showed that between the first and second year of having the implant they grew cancerous tumours. These studies showed that between 0.8-10.2% of the rodents and were affected. (The percentage range is quite spread for the reason being that there weren’t many studies done to look at the number of tumours found in rodents that hadn’t been microchipped). </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">There is also more research on health risks to do with microchipping, such as infection. Infection from microchipping can be caused by the materials the chip is made from and the reaction caused when mixing with bodily fluids such as blood. When implanted the body has a high chance of trying to reject the implant just like it does when you get a piercing. These rejections could come in the form of an infection or some other health issues. </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">There are more than just health risks that come along with microchipping, and these are things such as security risks. These are dangerous with how fast technology is developing and how smart people are getting while using technology.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">These security risks include things that could harm the economy and the person with the implant as there are high risks and threats related to hacking the implants. This is a major security and privacy issue as these microchips hold personal data such as names, birthdates, social security numbers and other personal information that only the user should be able to control. This risk is a major concern of security and privacy as there is a high chance of stolen identities and risks to human freedom.</p>
