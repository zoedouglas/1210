          <h1>Choices</h1>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">There are many choices when it comes to microchipping humans and as technology develops those choices and ideas will develop as well making it easier, healthier and safer for everyone with the chip. Choices include being able to pay with the microchip by presenting your hand to the machine just like you would with your card if you were paying via payWave or your phone if you were paying via apple pay.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2020 – 2027 of the healthcare microchips are expected to grow by up to 22% and cost over $6.4 million by 2027.  (Ford. S, 2021). According to a recent survey of employees in Europe and the United States, two-thirds of employees believe that by 2035 humans who are microchipped will be at more of an advantage in the market compared to those who aren’t for the main reason that there will be more technology and activities they can do and enjoy as they will be able to use their chip to access things that others won’t be able to. A big concern with having such an advantage is that there isn’t much privacy, and it wouldn’t be hard to track each individual who has the chip implanted. So, there is more development needed to make sure each human who has a chip is safe and not at risk of being tracked or hacked by a common person, a hacker, or the government who is supposed to protect them (Banafa. A, 2021).</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">In the United States they are working on a technology so that recognises that you have the signs of the coronavirus disease even before you realise. The Pentagon’s Defence Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) have revealed that they have created and developed a microchip that will constantly monitor the human body and check out for signs of infections and diseases just like the coronavirus (Tech News, 2021). </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">This development of technology will give humans many choices and options on what they would like to do. Over the next 10 or so years many choices are going to be made, developed and put out into the world for people to share their opinions on before they become a reality and the ones mentioned above are only a few of the many developing ideas out there. The idea of microchipping has many pros and cons so the future has a lot to hold and grow on which we will see some time soon.   </p>
