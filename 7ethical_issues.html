          <h1>Ethical Issues</h1>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">Ethical issues that have come along with microchipping humans are becoming very controversial and obvious by the day for many people. In a research paper done by Robert Billette in 2019 he found that an obvious ethical issue of radio frequency identification chips (RFID) was the legal policy. He said that laws should and will be issued to make sure privacy guidelines are in place and used by companies to prohibit people from tracking one another and to altogether keep all their data private and safe. The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) states, users have “the right of informational self-determination on each individual – including the right to remain master of the data concerning him or her” and alongside this a major legal team consisting of most if not all lawmakers and politicians will have to make sure their privacy rules are in place and clear to their citizens.  </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">The most controversial ethical issue overall that Billette 2019, talked about was human tracking and locating. This idea has a total dystopia to it. Location tracking is a major treat to one’s personal privacy and safety and needs to be addressed head on. The reason behind this being a major issue is because with large scale tracking there is a high chance of individuals being stalked, controlled by the government, and/or being more susceptible to having their privacy intruded. When it comes to a major security risk like this a way to get around it would be to have engineers, lawmakers and business men contribute to the legalisation of security and safety for the individuals with the chips. </p>
