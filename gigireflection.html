    <p style="text-align: justify">In this team project, our group is focusing on microchipping on humans. This is a brand-new topic for me, I have not heard it before. 
      During this project, I learned and know more about the current development of science and technology, such as our topic- microchipping in humans. 
      According to an article about the future of microchip implants in humans (2019), individuals with implants can access their homes, offices, 
      and gyms by simply swiping their hands against a digital reader, the chip can also be used to store emergency contacts, social media profiles, 
      house keys, and even e-tickets and public transportation. Besides, the users can also use the chips for store and restaurant payments. In my opinion, 
      microchipping definitely is a beneficial technology in the future. </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify">But, on the other hand, microchipping also have different privacy, social and security issues as potential risks. In research from Mitchell (2020),
         one major disadvantage of NFC-type devices is their ease of access, which means an unencrypted device would allow nearby attackers who do not require 
         physical contact, to obtain information stored on the device. Some companies around the world are beginning to try to implant devices in their employees. 
         People are worried that companies can use RFID devices to track their employees and monitor their behaviour. Although this does provide security advantages, 
         it can also be considered a serious violation of personal privacy and freedom. Those implanted devices cannot be turned off. Therefore, even if they are 
         not at work, employees will continue to carry devices that may be used. This concern even led a state in the United States to issue a ban on the company's 
         mandatory use of RFID for employees. In consonance with Merrill (2007), it gave the example of a drug addict who might choose to adopt a false identity in 
         order to obtain narcotics. The drug addict can simply hide the device on his body so that when the physician scanned him, his new ID would show on the reader.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">I am the researcher in the group project who carries out useful and related information from the internet. Since English is not my first language, I am 
          less confident to use English to communicate or even give a presentation in class. Through this project, I discovered that I could speak English bravely 
          and the importance of group cooperation. I have very good players, they encourage and understand me. I think I was not proactive enough in this cooperation,
           and I delayed everything until the end. From my perspective, I think I will have this situation because I have not really invested myself in this plan, 
           found my position, and just stayed at the level of completing the task. Insufficient learning initiative and self-consciousness. So, I feel that my 
           scientific research ability, the ability to analyze and solve problems is not enough. In the process of discussion, I will not take the initiative to speak 
           out my own opinions, just follow the instructions of the group members. If I have the opportunity to come again, I will take the initiative to participate 
           in this project and try my best to do better.</p>
