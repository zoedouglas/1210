    <p style="text-align: justify;">Something I learnt during this project is that there are major security risks that not many people think about when creating technology items. When I talk about the idea security issues companies do keep them in mind to an extent, but they always seem to miss out the idea of one individual hacking into another individuals chip or the idea of stalking. This is because they are so caught up in the amazing positives that come along with something like a microchip in people’s hands. From this I learnt that there is a lot of behind the scenes work that needs to be thought of and worked on constantly within the company but also with the government when it comes to law making to make sure that each individual who is getting microchipped has laws in place to keep them safe from people who may want to harm them at one point or another. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion something positive that I learnt from this assignment and researching the idea of microchipping humans was the idea of being able to just go anywhere without needing your wallet, car keys, house keys, gym card, office keys/key card etc. the idea of this is very appealing as it reduces waste, theft – personal and identity theft, as well as making it easy to go around places and not having to remember to being your wallet with you everywhere you go or not having to remember where you last placed your car keys down.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion something negative that I learnt from this assignment and researching the idea of microchipping humans was the idea of identity theft. This is a major thing that can occur with microchips as you only need a computer and access to the individuals files to be able to steal, change and edit their personal details. It’s as easy as a click of a button almost, which can be a terrifying idea and aspect of being microchipped. This is a major negative as these microchips hold a major amount of personal data so that the chip is personalised for the user as well as it being used for identification just like a driver’s license.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">During this assignment I am the team leader/coordinator. This was a very tough job as I struggled when it came to communicating with my group. One of my team members Gigi always replied and stayed in contact with me, she also turned up every lesson, even if it was a bit late she still showed up and helped me when it came to researching our topic. I struggled with my other team member, PJ as he never stayed in contact with us, and didn’t do any work when it came to researching or even helping to write out Gigi’s research as she struggles with English as its not her first language. It was a very tedious and time consuming task to be the team leader and to coordinate with my group but I can strongly say that Gigi and I did a lot of working together which made the project fun and even more enjoyable as I was able to make a good friends during the process. </p>
